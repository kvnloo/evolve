   - standard-checkpoint-hooks.sh: 179 lines duplicated
   - statusline-command.sh: 176 lines duplicated
   - All helper scripts duplicated between root and /research/
   Impact: Maintenance burden, version drift risk

   - 7,053 headers across documentation
   - Largest files: 2,757 lines (constitutional-ai-safety.md)
   - Multiple README files (32 total)
   - Heavy duplication in agent documentation

3. CODE QUALITY METRICS:
   JavaScript Files (2 total):
   - github-safe.js: 107 lines
     ✓ Clear comments and documentation
     ✓ Error handling present
     ✓ Modular function design
     ⚠ No input validation
     ⚠ No tests
     ⚠ Hardcoded timeout (30s)
   
   Shell Scripts:
   - checkpoint-manager.sh: 251 lines
     ✓ Good help documentation
     ✓ Color-coded output
     ✓ Error checking
     ⚠ No tests
     ⚠ Complex case statements
     ⚠ No shellcheck compliance unknown

4. TEST COVERAGE:
   ✗ Zero test files detected
   ✗ No test framework configured
   ✗ No CI/CD testing pipeline
   Impact: Code changes unvalidated, regression risk

5. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   ✗ No package.json at root
   ✗ No requirements.txt
   ✗ Dependencies managed via npx runtime
   Impact: Version pinning unclear, reproducibility issues

6. ANTI-PATTERNS DETECTED:
   - Massive duplication of helper scripts
   - No source code in conventional locations
   - Documentation-heavy, code-light structure
   - Mixed concerns (research + tooling)
   - No clear separation of executable vs docs

7. TECHNICAL DEBT MARKERS:
   - TODO/FIXME occurrences: Minimal in code
   - Bug references: Multiple in docs
   - Hack indicators: Not detected
   Impact: Low immediate debt, but structural issues

8. MAINTAINABILITY CONCERNS:
   - File organization: Research mixed with tooling
   - Naming consistency: Good (camelCase JS, kebab-case scripts)
   - Documentation quality: Excellent but excessive
   - Code readability: Good for existing code
   - Complexity: Low (minimal code)
   
9. SECURITY ANALYSIS:
   github-safe.js:
   ⚠ execSync usage with user input
   ⚠ Temporary file creation in /tmp
   ⚠ No input sanitization
   ✓ File cleanup in finally block
   
   Shell scripts:
   ⚠ git reset --hard option (destructive)
   ⚠ find with -delete (destructive)
   ✓ Backup creation before rollback

10. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Minimal code, performance not critical
    - Shell scripts use efficient commands
    - No obvious bottlenecks
    - Documentation parsing could be slow

QUALITY SCORE BREAKDOWN:

ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Current: Documentation-driven framework
Strengths:
- Comprehensive guidance
- Clear patterns
- Extensive examples

Weaknesses:
- Minimal executable code
- Heavy on configuration
- No validation layer
- Mixed concerns

Recommended Architecture:
1. /src - Executable tooling
2. /tests - Test suites
3. /docs - User documentation
4. /examples - Sample code
5. /scripts - Build/deploy scripts
6. /research - Separate repository

QUALITY GATES MISSING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✗ Pre-commit hooks
✗ Automated testing
✗ Code coverage requirements
✗ Security scanning
✗ Dependency vulnerability checks
✗ Documentation linting
✗ Shell script validation (shellcheck)
✗ Performance benchmarks

CONCLUSION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The repository is primarily a documentation and configuration framework
rather than a traditional codebase. Quality is HIGH for documentation
but LOW for software engineering practices. The minimal executable code
is well-written but completely untested and duplicated.

Priority actions: Eliminate duplication, add tests, implement security
hardening. Current technical debt is manageable (~24 hours) but will
grow exponentially if left unaddressed.

The framework shows promise but needs engineering rigor to be
production-ready. Documentation excellence does not substitute for
code quality fundamentals.
