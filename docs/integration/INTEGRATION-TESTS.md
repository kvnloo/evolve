# Integration Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Verify SuperClaude and CCPM systems coexist without conflicts
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Ready for validation

---

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Verify both systems are installed
ls -la .claude/commands/context/
ls -la .claude/commands/pm/

# Check namespace separation
grep -r "^/sc:" .claude/commands/ | wc -l  # Should show SuperClaude commands
grep -r "^/pm:" .claude/commands/ | wc -l  # Should show CCPM commands
```

### Baseline State
- [ ] SuperClaude commands in `.claude/commands/context/`
- [ ] CCPM commands in `.claude/commands/pm/`
- [ ] Both command sets registered with Claude Code
- [ ] No namespace conflicts in command names

---

## Test Suite 1: Namespace Isolation

### Test 1.1: Command Namespace Separation
**Objective**: Verify `/sc:` and `/pm:` commands don't conflict

**Test Case**:
```bash
# List all commands
find .claude/commands -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "^name:" {} \;

# Check for duplicate command names
find .claude/commands -name "*.md" -exec basename {} \; | sort | uniq -d
```

**Expected Result**:
- All SuperClaude commands start with `/sc:`
- All CCPM commands start with `/pm:`
- No duplicate command names exist
- Each command has unique functionality

**Test Steps**:
1. Execute: `find .claude/commands -type f -name "*.md" | xargs grep -h "^name:" | sort`
2. Verify no duplicate names
3. Verify namespace prefixes are correct
4. Check command descriptions for overlap

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] No duplicate command names
- [ ] `/sc:` commands only in `context/` directory
- [ ] `/pm:` commands only in `pm/` directory
- [ ] No namespace collisions

**Actual Result**: _To be filled during test execution_

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

### Test 1.2: Configuration File Isolation
**Objective**: Verify configuration files don't overwrite each other

**Test Case**:
```bash
# Check for configuration conflicts
ls -la .claude/*.json .claude/*.config 2>/dev/null

# Verify file ownership
find .claude -name "*.json" -o -name "*.config" | xargs ls -l
```

**Expected Result**:
- `ccpm.config` exists (CCPM configuration)
- SuperClaude uses global `~/.claude/` configurations
- No shared configuration files
- Each system has isolated settings

**Test Steps**:
1. List all configuration files in `.claude/`
2. Verify `ccpm.config` is CCPM-specific
3. Check SuperClaude doesn't create conflicting configs
4. Validate both systems work with their respective configs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `ccpm.config` present and valid
- [ ] No SuperClaude configs in `.claude/` root
- [ ] Both systems read correct configurations
- [ ] Configuration changes don't affect other system

**Actual Result**: _To be filled during test execution_

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

## Test Suite 2: Concurrent Execution

### Test 2.1: Parallel Command Execution
**Objective**: Test running both systems simultaneously

**Test Case**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run SuperClaude command
/sc:analyze "Review project structure"

# Terminal 2: Run CCPM command (while above is running)
/pm:next
```

**Expected Result**:
- Both commands execute without blocking
- No file locking conflicts
- Each system completes its task independently
- No corrupted output or state

**Test Steps**:
1. Start `/sc:analyze` in one Claude Code session
2. Immediately start `/pm:next` in another session
3. Monitor for conflicts or errors
4. Verify both complete successfully
5. Check for any corrupted files

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Both commands complete successfully
- [ ] No file system conflicts
- [ ] Output from both is coherent
- [ ] No error messages about locks/conflicts

**Actual Result**: _To be filled during test execution_

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

### Test 2.2: Memory/State Isolation
**Objective**: Verify each system maintains independent state

**Test Case**:
```bash
# SuperClaude: Create analysis state
/sc:analyze "Codebase quality"

# CCPM: Create work state
/pm:issue-start 123

# Verify independence
cat .claude/epics/*/updates/* 2>/dev/null  # CCPM state
# SuperClaude state in memory (not persisted locally)
```

**Expected Result**:
- SuperClaude uses in-memory state (via MCP)
- CCPM uses file-based state (in `.claude/epics/`)
- No state leakage between systems
- Each maintains independent context

**Test Steps**:
1. Execute SuperClaude command with state
2. Execute CCPM command with state
3. Verify state storage locations are different
4. Check no cross-system state pollution
5. Confirm both systems function correctly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] SuperClaude state in MCP memory
- [ ] CCPM state in `.claude/epics/`
- [ ] No shared state files
- [ ] Independent context maintenance

**Actual Result**: _To be filled during test execution_

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

## Test Suite 3: Agent Overlap

### Test 3.1: Agent Naming Conflicts
**Objective**: Verify overlapping agent names coexist

**Test Case**:
```bash
# SuperClaude agents: researcher, coder, tester, architect, etc.
# CCPM agents: backend-specialist, frontend-specialist, etc.

# Test overlapping "researcher" agent
/sc:research "Latest React patterns"  # Uses SuperClaude researcher
/pm:issue-start 123  # May use CCPM researcher role
```

**Expected Result**:
- SuperClaude agents use MCP coordination
- CCPM agents use worktree isolation
- No agent identity conflicts
- Both can use "researcher" role independently

**Test Steps**:
1. Identify overlapping agent names (researcher, coder, etc.)
2. Execute SuperClaude command using shared agent name
3. Execute CCPM command using same agent name
4. Verify both use correct implementation
5. Check no agent state mixing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Both systems use their own agent implementations
- [ ] No agent state confusion
- [ ] Agent coordination works per-system
- [ ] No error about duplicate agents

**Actual Result**: _To be filled during test execution_

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

### Test 3.2: Agent Coordination Patterns
**Objective**: Test different coordination mechanisms don't interfere

**Test Case**:
```bash
# SuperClaude: Swarm coordination via MCP
/sc:implement "Add user authentication"

# CCPM: Worktree-based coordination
/pm:epic-oneshot "User Authentication System"
```

**Expected Result**:
- SuperClaude uses MCP swarm coordination
- CCPM uses git worktree coordination
- No coordination mechanism conflicts
- Each system maintains its pattern

**Test Steps**:
1. Start SuperClaude task with agent swarm
2. Start CCPM epic with worktree agents
3. Monitor coordination mechanisms
4. Verify no cross-system interference
5. Check both complete successfully

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] SuperClaude agents coordinate via MCP

- [ ] No coordination conflicts
- [ ] Both patterns work independently

**Actual Result**: _To be filled during test execution_

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

git diff .claude/CLAUDE.md
git diff .claude/rules/
```

**Expected Result**:
- SuperClaude commands unchanged
- CCPM commands unchanged
- No modifications to protected files
- All integrations are additive only

**Test Steps**:
1. Record checksums of protected files before integration
2. Run integration setup
3. Compare checksums after integration
4. Verify no unexpected modifications
5. Check git status for changes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] No changes to existing SuperClaude files
