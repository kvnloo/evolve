## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Multi-agent coordination failures | Medium | High | Start with 2-3 agents, scale incrementally; fallback to single-agent mode |
| LLM performance degradation | Medium | High | Automated monitoring with alerts; recontextualization and prompt optimization |
| 3D mesh quality issues | High | Medium | Template-based generation with validation; manual cleanup fallback |
| Knowledge base staleness | Low | Medium | Automated freshness checks; scheduled updates; direct web search fallback |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Cost overruns | Medium | Medium | Hard spending limits; prompt caching; reduce parallelism if needed |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Constitutional AI framework; automated scanning; sandboxed execution |
| Team adoption resistance | Medium | High | Comprehensive training; gradual rollout; hybrid workflow option |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| ROI below expectations | Low | High | Focus on high-priority items (Score ≥7.5); quick wins; phased approach |
| Technology obsolescence | Low | Medium | Open standards (MCP); avoid vendor lock-in; modular architecture |
| Regulatory compliance | Low | Critical | Audit trails; data governance; Constitutional AI; legal review |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Install SuperClaude**: `pipx install SuperClaude && SuperClaude install`
2. **Configure Core MCPs**: Linear, GitHub, Postgres
3. **Set up Git Worktrees**: Test parallel agent execution
4. **Define Constitutional Principles**: Draft `.claude/CONSTITUTION.md`

### Week 1 Kickoff
1. Create GitHub project board with all epics and stories
2. Convert stories to GitHub Issues with sub-issues
3. Assign initial stories to team members
4. Establish baseline productivity metrics
5. Begin Epic 1, Story 1.1 (SuperClaude integration)

### Monthly Reviews
- **Week 4**: Foundation checkpoint (2-3x gains)
- **Week 8**: Knowledge & Optimization checkpoint (4-5x gains)
- **Week 14**: Advanced Capabilities checkpoint (6-7x gains)
- **Week 20**: Production deployment and final validation (7-10x gains)

## Conclusion

This CCPM development plan provides a systematic, research-backed path to implementing the **Evolve** autonomous development framework. By prioritizing high-impact, production-proven technologies and building incrementally, the plan achieves:

- **Week 4**: 2-3x productivity improvement (Foundation)
- **Week 8**: 4-5x productivity improvement (Knowledge & Optimization)
- **Week 14**: 6-7x productivity improvement (Advanced Capabilities)
- **Week 20**: 7-10x productivity improvement (Autonomous Systems)

**Total Investment**: $2,500-8,000 (software + infrastructure)
**Expected ROI**: 3-7x productivity by end of timeline
**Risk Level**: Low (production-proven technologies, incremental adoption)

The modular approach allows adaptation based on emerging needs, budget constraints, and team capacity. Each epic delivers standalone value while building foundations for subsequent capabilities.
