# Credits & Attribution

This project integrates and extends several open-source frameworks to create an autonomous AI development environment.

## Primary Frameworks

### Claude Flow
- **Author**: [@ruvnet](https://github.com/ruvnet)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow
- **Purpose**: SPARC methodology engine, multi-agent orchestration, neural training systems
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Integration**: Provides the core SPARC workflow (Specification → Pseudocode → Architecture → Refinement → Completion), 54+ specialized agents for development tasks, swarm coordination topologies (hierarchical, mesh, adaptive), and neural pattern learning capabilities.

**Key Features Used**:
- SPARC methodology for systematic TDD workflows
- Multi-agent coordination with Byzantine fault tolerance
- Parallel execution optimization (2.8-4.4x speed improvement)
- Neural training and pattern recognition (27+ models)
- Performance metrics: 84.8% SWE-Bench solve rate, 32.3% token reduction

### CCPM (Claude Code Project Management)
- **Author**: [Automaze.io](https://github.com/automazeio)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm
- **Purpose**: Spec-driven development, GitHub issue synchronization, epic management
- **License**: MIT
- **Integration**: Provides project management layer with PRD (Product Requirement Document) workflows, automated epic decomposition, GitHub issue bidirectional sync, git worktree-based parallel development, and privacy-protected path standards.

**Key Features Used**:
- PRD brainstorming and structured requirements
- Epic-to-issue decomposition automation
- Git worktree workflows for parallel development
- GitHub issue synchronization and progress tracking
- Repository protection and privacy safeguards

### SuperClaude Framework
- **Source**: Community-developed behavioral modes and advanced patterns
- **Purpose**: Enhanced Claude Code capabilities through context-aware execution strategies
- **License**: Community/Public Domain
- **Integration**: Behavioral modes for different development contexts, symbol-based token efficiency, deep research capabilities, introspection and meta-cognitive analysis, business analysis panel with expert frameworks.

**Key Features Used**:
- Brainstorming Mode: Socratic dialogue for requirement discovery
- Deep Research Mode: Multi-hop investigation with source credibility
- Introspection Mode: Meta-cognitive reasoning analysis
- Task Management Mode: Hierarchical task organization with memory
- Token Efficiency Mode: Symbol-enhanced communication (30-50% reduction)
- Business Panel Mode: Multi-expert strategic analysis

## Integration Architecture

**This project's unique contribution** is the integration architecture that combines these frameworks into a cohesive system:

- **Configuration Synthesis**: Unified CLAUDE.md configuration merging all framework capabilities
- **Workflow Coordination**: Seamless handoffs between SPARC phases, agent swarms, and PM workflows
- **Documentation Organization**: Structured knowledge base with clear framework attribution
- **Privacy & Security**: Path sanitization, repository validation, safe automation patterns
- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined setup, clear documentation, portfolio presentation

## Additional Technologies

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers
- **claude-flow**: SPARC and agent coordination
- **ruv-swarm**: Enhanced swarm coordination (optional)
- **flow-nexus**: Cloud-based advanced features (optional)

### Development Tools
- **Claude Code**: AI-powered development environment by Anthropic
- **GitHub CLI**: Repository and issue management integration
- **Git**: Version control and worktree workflows
- **Node.js/npm**: Package management and tooling
