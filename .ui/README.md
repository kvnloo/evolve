# .ui Workspace

This directory contains all files generated by the `/ui:*` commands for pixel-perfect website cloning and design work.

## Directory Structure

```
.ui/
├── screenshots/          # Full-page screenshots of websites
├── extracted-css/        # Extracted CSS from target websites
├── *-style-guide.md     # Generated style guides
├── *.html               # Generated HTML files
└── README.md            # This file
```

## Quick Start

### 1. First-time Setup

Run the setup script to install required tools:

```bash
.claude/commands/ui/_setup-screenshot-tools.sh
```

This will:
- Install `shot-scraper` for automated screenshot capture
- Initialize browser engines
- Create workspace directories
- Run a test screenshot

### 2. Clone a Website

Use the `/ui:clone-website` command:

```
/ui:clone-website https://example.com
```

This will automatically:
1. Capture a full-page screenshot
2. Extract all CSS from the website
3. Generate a comprehensive style guide
4. Create pixel-perfect HTML with Tailwind CSS
5. Save all files to this `.ui/` directory

### 3. View Results

All generated files will be in this directory:
- Screenshot: `.ui/screenshots/{name}-{timestamp}.png`
- CSS: `.ui/extracted-css/{name}-{timestamp}.css`
- Style Guide: `.ui/{name}-style-guide.md`
- HTML: `.ui/{name}.html`

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Clone Linear's homepage
/ui:clone-website https://linear.app

# Files created:
# - .ui/screenshots/linear-app-2025-11-02-143022.png
# - .ui/extracted-css/linear-app-2025-11-02-143022.css
# - .ui/linear-app-style-guide.md
# - .ui/linear-app.html

# Open the generated HTML
open .ui/linear-app.html
```

## File Versioning

- **Screenshots** and **CSS files** are timestamped for version tracking
- **Style guides** and **HTML files** use the style name only (latest overwrites previous)
- This allows iterative refinement while preserving source captures

## Gitignore

The following directories are gitignored (temporary/generated content):
- `.ui/screenshots/` - Screenshot images are large and regenerable
- `.ui/extracted-css/` - CSS can be re-extracted from source

The following files are **NOT gitignored** (design artifacts):
- `.ui/*-style-guide.md` - Style guides are valuable documentation
- `.ui/*.html` - Generated HTML is the final deliverable

## Tips

1. **For complex sites**: Start with the homepage, then clone specific sections
2. **For iterative design**: Keep the style guide, regenerate HTML as needed
3. **For responsive design**: Screenshots are desktop (1920px) by default
4. **For custom styling**: Edit the style guide before generating HTML

## Troubleshooting

### Screenshot fails
- Check URL is accessible
- Verify network connection
- Try increasing `--wait` time for slow-loading sites

### CSS extraction fails
- Some sites use JS-generated CSS (acceptable)
- Proceed with screenshot-only analysis
- Style guide will extract colors/fonts from visual analysis

### HTML doesn't match
- Compare against screenshot side-by-side
- Check style guide for accuracy
- Provide specific feedback for iteration

## Commands Reference
