## 🎯 Key Research Needs

**Critical Gaps:**
- ❌ Production architecture patterns for AI systems
- ❌ Scalability patterns for agent swarms
- ❌ Distributed consensus for multi-agent coordination
- ❌ Event-driven architecture best practices

**Next Steps:**
1. Document continuous research architecture patterns
2. Research distributed systems for agents
3. Study event-driven architectures at scale
4. Identify production deployment patterns
