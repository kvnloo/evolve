        """Progressive retrieval across tiers"""
        if tier == "auto":
            tier = self.select_tier(context)

        results = []
        if tier >= 1: results.extend(self.immediate.search(context))

npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-[id]"

# During-Task Hooks (Memory Updates)
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "[what was done]"

# Post-Task Hooks (Memory Persistence)
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```

### 4.2 Agent Execution Patterns

From CLAUDE.md critical rules:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Use Claude Code's Task tool for parallel agent execution
[Single Message]:
  Task("Research agent", "Analyze requirements and patterns...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder agent", "Implement core features...", "coder")
  Task("Database agent", "Design and implement database schema...", "code-analyzer")
  Task("Tester agent", "Create comprehensive test suite with 90% coverage.", "tester")
  Task("Reviewer agent", "Review code quality and security. Document findings.", "reviewer")

  // Batch ALL todos in ONE call
  TodoWrite { todos: [...8-10 todos...] }

  // Parallel file operations
  Bash "mkdir -p app/{src,tests,docs,config}"
  Write "backend/server.js"
  Write "frontend/App.jsx"
  Write "database/schema.sql"
```

**Golden Rule**: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Performance Impact**:
- Parallel execution: 4-6x faster than sequential
- Reduced context switching: 89% reduction
- Token efficiency: 15x usage justified by quality
- Error detection: 3x improvement through multi-agent review

### 4.3 Agent Coordination Protocol

Every agent spawned via Task tool MUST execute hooks:

**Before Work**:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-[id]"
```

**During Work**:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "[what was done]"
```

**After Work**:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```

**Production Pipeline**:
```
Pre-production → 3D Modeling → UV Mapping → Texturing/Shaders →
Rigging (if animated) → Animation → Lighting → Rendering → Compositing
```

AI accelerates steps 2-4 (Modeling, UV, Texturing) while human oversight remains critical for others.

        """Generate new tasks from unsuccessful attempts"""
        for task in failed_tasks:
            failure_mode = analyze_failure(task)
            variants = create_task_variants(task, difficulty=-1)
            yield from variants

    def adapt_difficulty(self, agent_performance):
        """Adjust task complexity based on agent capabilities"""
        if agent_performance > 0.8:
            return generate_harder_tasks()
        elif agent_performance < 0.3:
            return generate_easier_tasks()
        else:
            return maintain_difficulty()
```

## 9. Architectural Patterns and Best Practices

### 9.1 Concurrency and Parallelization

**Golden Rule**: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Mandatory Patterns**:
- TodoWrite: Batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ minimum)
- Task tool: Spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- File operations: Batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- Bash commands: Batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- Memory operations: Batch ALL store/retrieve in ONE message

**Performance Impact**:
- 84.8% SWE-Bench solve rate
- 32.3% token reduction
- 2.8-4.4x speed improvement
- 89% context switching reduction

### 9.2 File Organization Standards

**NEVER save to root folder. Use these directories**:
- `/src` - Source code files
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation and markdown files
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts
- `/examples` - Example code
- `/research` - Research documents and findings

**Critical for CEA Development**:
```
.claude/
  ├── architecture/          # IMMUTABLE (Level 1)
  │   ├── greenhouse-structure.md
  │   └── safety-protocols.md
  ├── business-logic/        # SEMI-MUTABLE (Level 2)
  │   ├── climate-control-algorithms.md
  │   └── irrigation-scheduling.md
  ├── implementation/        # MUTABLE (Level 3)
  │   ├── sensor-configurations.md
  │   └── api-endpoints.md
  └── ui/                    # HIGHLY MUTABLE (Level 4)
      └── dashboard-themes.md
```

### 9.3 Error Handling and Recovery

**Multi-Layer Defense**:
1. Retry strategies with exponential backoff
2. Fallback patterns (primary → secondary → tertiary)
3. Circuit breakers preventing cascading failures
4. LLM-based adaptation (inform agents, choose alternatives)
5. Graceful degradation with reduced functionality

**Production Implementation**:
```python
async def execute_with_recovery(operation, max_retries=3):

## 11. Risk Management

### 11.1 Technical Risks

**LLM API Outages** (High Probability, High Impact)
- Mitigation: Local LLM fallback (Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B), multi-provider setup
- Contingency: Graceful degradation with offline capabilities

**Memory Scalability** (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
- Mitigation: MIRIX tiered architecture, semantic compression
- Contingency: Upgrade to distributed vector DB (Pinecone, Qdrant)

**Context Degradation** (High Probability, Medium Impact)
- Mitigation: Progressive summarization, hierarchical context management
- Contingency: Recontextualization triggers, sliding windows

### 11.2 Operational Risks

**Cost Overruns** (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
- Mitigation: Cost optimization stack (caching, cascading, compression)
- Contingency: Model downgrade, batch processing, aggressive caching

**Timeline Delays** (Medium Probability, Low Impact)
- Mitigation: Agile sprints, continuous delivery, scope adjustment
- Contingency: Prioritize critical path, defer non-essential features

**Team Adoption** (Low Probability, Medium Impact)
- Mitigation: Comprehensive training, gradual rollout, champion program
- Contingency: Hybrid workflows (autonomous + manual)

### 11.3 Strategic Risks

**Changing Requirements** (High Probability, Low Impact)
- Mitigation: Flexible architecture, modular design, version control
- Contingency: Rapid pivot capabilities, iterative development

**Competitive Developments** (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
