## Scoring Methodology

**Priority Score Formula:**
```
Score = (Impact × 0.30) + (Feasibility × 0.25) + (Urgency × 0.20) + (Cost × 0.15) + (Risk × 0.10)
```

**Each dimension scored 0-10:**
- **Impact:** Potential value delivered
- **Feasibility:** Ease of implementation
- **Urgency:** Time-sensitivity
- **Cost:** Resource requirements (inverted: 10=low, 0=high)
- **Risk:** Technical/operational risk (inverted: 10=low, 0=high)

**Categories:**
- HIGH: Score ≥ 7.5
- MEDIUM: Score 5.0-7.4
- LOW: Score < 5.0
