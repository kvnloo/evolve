# Architecture Analysis Test

This is a test research document to validate the autosave hook system.

## Key Findings

- Hook system successfully triggers on file edits
- Memory storage uses structured keys: research/[category]/[timestamp]
- Cross-referencing enables knowledge graph building
- Confidence scoring based on content quality indicators

## Architecture Decisions

The research autosave hook provides:

* Automatic capture of research insights
* Structured memory organization by category
* Cross-reference tracking for related research
* Metadata extraction from frontmatter
* Confidence scoring for quality assessment

## Conclusions

- Automated memory persistence reduces manual overhead
- Structured keys enable efficient retrieval and querying
- Cross-references create knowledge graph for synthesis
- Confidence scores help prioritize high-quality research
