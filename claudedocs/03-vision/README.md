# 03-VISION: Strategic Vision & Future Direction

**Purpose**: Strategic vision, concepts, and future direction for the project.

## The C(RAID) Paradigm

**The foundational paradigm shift that enables truly autonomous AI development.**

C(RAID) - Continuous Research, Analysis, Integration, Deployment - represents an evolution of traditional CI/CD designed specifically for autonomous LLM-based development. While CI/CD assumes human developers write code first, C(RAID) recognizes that AI agents must **research and analyze** before they can build effectively.

> **See**: [CRAID_PARADIGM.md](./CRAID_PARADIGM.md) for the complete paradigm documentation.
