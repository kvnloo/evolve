⚠️ HISTORICAL NOTE: Documentation Consolidation Analysis (2025-11)

## Overview
This directory contains analysis artifacts from the November 2025 documentation consolidation efforts.

## Purpose
These documents were created to analyze and plan the consolidation of:
- Statusline enhancement documentation (scattered across 4+ files)
- Research documentation (in multiple formats and locations)
- General documentation cleanup

## Status: ASPIRATIONAL PLANNING
Most proposals in these documents were **not fully executed** as written. They served as discussion and planning artifacts rather than implementation blueprints.

## What Actually Happened
See the Phase 1-6 commits (Nov 26, 2025) for actual consolidation work:
- Created `claudedocs/active_research/INDEX.md`
- Consolidated statusline docs (4 → 2 files)
- Created archive structure in `claudedocs/99-archive/`

## Files in This Directory
- `docs-consolidation-plan.md` - Statusline doc consolidation proposal
- `statusline-doc-consolidation.md` - Detailed statusline cleanup plan

*Archived as historical planning artifacts. See git history for actual implementations.*
