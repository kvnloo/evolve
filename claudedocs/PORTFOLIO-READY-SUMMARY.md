## Using This in Interviews

### Portfolio Talking Points

**"Tell me about a complex project you've worked on"**
> "I built an integrated AI development framework combining three specialized tools - Claude Flow's SPARC methodology, CCPM's project management system, and SuperClaude's behavioral modes. The challenge was creating a cohesive system where each framework's capabilities enhanced the others without conflicts..."

**"How do you approach documentation?"**
> "I believe in single-source-of-truth documentation that's minimal but complete. For this project, I consolidated 15+ duplicate docs into clear guides, added proper framework attribution, and created a navigation structure that gets users productive in under 10 minutes..."

**"What's your experience with open source?"**
> "This project showcases my approach to open source integration - properly attributing upstream frameworks, maintaining clear licensing, and contributing back through improved documentation and integration patterns..."
