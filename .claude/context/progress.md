## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Complete GitHub Configuration ⏳ (30-40 minutes)
- [ ] Create develop branch: `git checkout -b develop && git push -u origin develop`
- [ ] Configure branch protection for main (require PR + status checks passing)
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
- [ ] Document branching strategy in `docs/branching-strategy.md`

### 2. Begin Epic 1 Implementation 📋 (Week 1, Days 1-3)
- [ ] **Decompose Epic 1** using `/pm:epic-oneshot "Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure"`
- [ ] **Sync to GitHub** with `/pm:epic-sync` to create Issues
- [ ] **Start first story** with `/pm:issue-start [number]`
- [ ] **Test CCPM workflow** end-to-end with real task
- [ ] **Validate multi-agent coordination** with parallel execution
- [ ] **Test automation workflows** (checkpoint, CI working correctly)

### 3. Constitutional AI Implementation 📋 (Week 1, Days 4-5)
- [ ] Implement 7 immutable safety principles in CI pipeline
- [ ] Create validation and monitoring system
- [ ] Add safety checks to GitHub workflows
- [ ] Test with example scenarios and edge cases

### 4. Additional MCP Servers (Optional) 📋 (Week 2)
- [ ] Consider adding: Sequential (reasoning), Context7 (docs), Morphllm (edits)
- [ ] Test Playwright MCP for browser automation
- [ ] Evaluate Serena MCP for session memory
- [ ] Only install if specific use case identified
