- ✅ Hive mind analysis and synthesis
- ✅ Digital twin design documentation
- ✅ Autonomous Claude Code systems research
- ✅ SWE-bench self-improving prompts research
- ✅ Farm automation and compute systems research

### Infrastructure Setup ✅
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Claude Flow integration configured
- ✅ CCPM (Claude Code PM) system installed
- ✅ GitHub CLI authenticated and configured
- ✅ MCP servers configured (.mcp.json)
- ✅ Hook system established

### Documentation ✅

- ✅ CCPM installation guide

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Context Initialization** (Current)
   - Create initial context documentation
   - Establish baseline project understanding

2. **Git Cleanup**
   - Review and commit pending changes
   - Organize untracked files properly

3. **Project Structure**
   - Define source code directory structure
   - Set up test infrastructure
   - Establish build system

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Implement first feature using SPARC methodology
   - Test agent coordination system
   - Validate hook automation

## Blockers & Issues

None currently identified.

## Success Metrics

- Research documentation: **Extensive** (20+ research files)
- Infrastructure setup: **Complete** (CCPM, Claude Flow, Git, GitHub CLI)
- Agent coordination: **Configured** (54 specialized agents available)
- Development methodology: **Established** (SPARC TDD workflow)
- Next: Begin actual feature development

## Notes

This project is in the foundational stage with comprehensive research completed. The focus now shifts from research and setup to active development using the established SPARC methodology and agent coordination system.
