# Project Brief

## What Is Evolve?

**Evolve** is an AI-driven autonomous development framework that combines systematic methodology (SPARC), multi-agent coordination, and intelligent automation to enable faster, higher-quality software development.

## Core Problem

Modern AI-assisted development faces several challenges:
1. **Lost Context** - Developers lose context between sessions
2. **Manual Coordination** - Complex tasks require manual orchestration
3. **Inconsistent Methods** - No systematic approach to AI-assisted development
4. **Sequential Bottlenecks** - Single-threaded development limits speed
5. **Quality Trade-offs** - Speed often compromises quality

## Solution Approach

Evolve addresses these challenges through four key innovations:

### 1. SPARC Methodology
**Systematic Development Workflow**
- Specification before implementation
- Pseudocode before coding
- Architecture before building
- Refinement through TDD
- Completion with validation

**Result**: Higher quality code with fewer bugs

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination
**Parallel Distributed Development**
- 54 specialized agent types
- Multiple coordination patterns (hierarchical, mesh, adaptive)
- Consensus mechanisms for reliability
- Distributed memory for context sharing

**Result**: 2.8-4.4x faster development through parallelization

### 3. CCPM Integration
**Seamless Project Management**
- PRD to epic to issue workflow
- GitHub synchronization
- Git worktree automation
- Context preservation

**Result**: No context switching between tools

### 4. Intelligent Automation
**Hook-Driven Workflow**
- Automatic formatting and quality checks
- Memory synchronization
- Pattern learning
- Session state management

**Result**: 32.3% token reduction, consistent quality

## Project Scope

### In Scope
‚úÖ Development methodology framework (SPARC)
‚úÖ Agent coordination system
‚úÖ Project management commands (CCPM)
‚úÖ GitHub integration
‚úÖ Hook automation system
‚úÖ Context and memory management
‚úÖ Research documentation and organization
‚úÖ Cross-session state preservation

### Out of Scope (Current Phase)
‚ùå Specific application domain (framework is domain-agnostic)
‚ùå User interface (CLI-based through Claude Code)
‚ùå Cloud deployment (local development focus)
‚ùå Multi-user real-time collaboration (GitHub-based async)

### Future Scope
‚è≥ Visual workflow designer
‚è≥ Advanced neural training and optimization
‚è≥ Real-time team collaboration
‚è≥ Cloud-based coordination
‚è≥ Language-specific optimizations

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Accelerate Development** - Achieve 2.8-4.4x speedup through parallel agents
2. **Maintain Quality** - Systematic SPARC methodology ensures high quality
3. **Preserve Context** - Never lose understanding between sessions
4. **Enable Coordination** - Seamless multi-agent collaboration
5. **Automate Workflows** - Reduce manual repetitive tasks

### Secondary Objectives
1. Learn and improve from patterns
2. Support research and exploration
3. Integrate with standard tools (Git, GitHub)
4. Provide extensible architecture
5. Enable continuous improvement

## Success Metrics

### Development Speed
- **Target**: 2.8-4.4x faster than traditional development
- **Measure**: Time to feature completion comparison
- **Current**: Infrastructure phase, not yet measured

### Code Quality
- **Target**: 84.8% SWE-Bench solve rate (documented capability)
- **Measure**: Test coverage, bug density, code review scores
- **Current**: No features implemented yet to measure

### Token Efficiency
- **Target**: 32.3% token reduction (documented capability)
- **Measure**: Token usage per feature implementation
- **Current**: Infrastructure commands established

### Context Retention
- **Target**: 100% context preservation between sessions
- **Measure**: Successful resumption without information loss
- **Current**: Context system established, needs validation

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must work within Claude Code environment
- Requires Git repository
- Depends on GitHub CLI for PM features
- Needs Node.js/npx for Claude Flow

### Resource Constraints
- Token budget management required
- Agent coordination has overhead
- Memory storage requirements
- Network dependency for GitHub sync

### Assumptions
- Users have Claude Code access
- GitHub repository available
- Basic Git knowledge
- Command-line comfort
- Node.js installed

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Coordination Overhead
**Impact**: Agent coordination may slow down simple tasks
**Mitigation**: Adaptive topology selection, single-agent fallback
**Probability**: Medium

### Risk: Learning Curve
**Impact**: SPARC methodology unfamiliar to developers
**Mitigation**: Extensive documentation, guided workflows
**Probability**: Medium

### Risk: Tool Dependencies
**Impact**: GitHub CLI or Claude Flow unavailable
**Mitigation**: Graceful degradation, clear error messages
**Probability**: Low

### Risk: Token Budget Exhaustion
**Impact**: Context size exceeds limits
**Mitigation**: Efficient memory management, token optimization
**Probability**: Medium

### Risk: Context Corruption
**Impact**: Saved context becomes invalid
**Mitigation**: Validation checks, backup mechanisms
**Probability**: Low
