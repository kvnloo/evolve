- Consensus mechanisms (Byzantine, Raft, Gossip, CRDT)
- Distributed memory management
- Intelligent agent routing

**User Value**: Massively parallel development with intelligent task distribution

### 3. CCPM (Claude Code PM) System
**Purpose**: Project management integrated with development
**Components**:
- Product requirement document (PRD) management
- Epic decomposition and GitHub synchronization
- Issue workflow automation
- Git worktree integration
- Context management

**User Value**: Seamless project management without leaving development environment

### 4. Research & Knowledge Management
**Purpose**: Systematic research organization and synthesis
**Components**:
- Research documentation structure
- Memory systems (session, agent, collective)
- Research automation hooks
- Pattern learning and reuse
- Cross-session context preservation

**User Value**: Organized research with continuous learning and improvement

### 5. Automation & Hook System
**Purpose**: Intelligent automation throughout development lifecycle
**Components**:
- Pre-task preparation hooks
- Post-edit automation hooks
- Post-task cleanup hooks
- Session management hooks
- Memory coordination hooks

**User Value**: Reduced manual work with consistent quality

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Feature Development with SPARC
**Actor**: Developer
**Goal**: Implement new feature with high quality
**Flow**:
1. Create PRD using `/pm:prd-new`
2. Decompose into epic with `/pm:epic-decompose`
3. Sync to GitHub with `/pm:epic-sync`
4. Start work with `/pm:issue-start`
5. SPARC workflow automatically executes:
   - Specification analysis
   - Pseudocode design
   - Architecture planning
   - TDD refinement
   - Integration completion
6. Automated hooks handle formatting, testing, documentation

**Outcome**: Feature implemented with tests, documentation, and quality checks

### Use Case 2: Multi-Stream Development
**Actor**: Development team
**Goal**: Parallel development on related features
**Flow**:
1. Initialize swarm with coordination topology
2. Spawn multiple specialized agents (backend, frontend, testing, etc.)
3. Agents work in parallel on different work streams
4. Coordination via distributed memory
5. Automatic conflict detection and resolution
6. Synchronized commits and progress tracking

**Outcome**: Faster development with coordinated parallel work

### Use Case 3: Research Documentation & Synthesis
**Actor**: Researcher
**Goal**: Conduct and organize systematic research
**Flow**:
1. Configure research topic and scope
2. Automated research with intelligent search
3. Document findings in structured format
4. Research autosave hooks preserve work
5. Memory system maintains context
6. Pattern learning improves future research

**Outcome**: Comprehensive research with automatic organization and learning

### Use Case 4: Context Preservation Across Sessions
**Actor**: Developer returning to project
**Goal**: Resume work without loss of context
**Flow**:
1. Run `/context:prime` to load saved context
2. System restores:
   - Project state and progress
   - Technical context and decisions
   - Pattern learnings
   - Work streams and priorities
3. Developer immediately productive with full context

**Outcome**: Seamless continuation with no ramp-up time

### Use Case 5: GitHub Integration Workflow
**Actor**: Development team
**Goal**: Manage project through GitHub Issues and PRs
**Flow**:
1. PRD → Epic decomposition
2. Epic → GitHub Issues synchronization
3. Issues → Local worktrees for development
4. Development → Commits with issue references
5. Completion → Pull requests
6. Merge → Context updates

**Outcome**: Unified workflow from planning to production
