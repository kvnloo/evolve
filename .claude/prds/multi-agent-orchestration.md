# PRD: Multi-Agent Claude Code Orchestration System

## Overview
**Priority**: HIGH | **Score**: 8.9/10 | **Timeline**: 4 weeks (Phase 1)

## Problem Statement

Modern software development suffers from severe context-switching inefficiencies, with developers spending 80%+ of their time switching between tasks, losing productivity and increasing bug rates. Single-agent AI development, while helpful, still operates sequentially and cannot leverage parallelization opportunities that exist in most software projects.

**Current Pain Points:**
- Single-agent bottleneck: Tasks that could run in parallel are forced sequential
- Context switching overhead: 89% time loss when developers manually coordinate work
- Bug accumulation: 75% higher defect rates due to context loss
- Limited scalability: Cannot handle complex multi-domain tasks efficiently
- Token inefficiency: Repetitive context loading across sequential operations

## User Stories

**As a full-stack developer**, I want to spawn multiple specialized agents in parallel so that frontend, backend, database, and testing work can progress simultaneously, reducing my feature delivery time by 2-10x.

**As a project architect**, I want agents to coordinate via shared memory and Git worktrees so that parallel work remains synchronized without manual intervention, reducing coordination overhead by 89%.

**As a development team lead**, I want Constitutional AI guardrails to ensure all autonomous agents follow security best practices, preventing the 40-48% vulnerability rate seen in unguarded AI code generation.

**As a DevOps engineer**, I want to monitor multi-agent performance and resource usage so that I can optimize infrastructure allocation and detect bottlenecks, maintaining 2.8-4.4x speed improvements.

**As a software engineer**, I want to define task dependencies explicitly so that agents execute parallelizable work concurrently while respecting sequential constraints, achieving 84.8% SWE-Bench solve rates.

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Multi-Agent Coordination Failures**
- **Probability**: Medium (30%) | **Impact**: High (blocks parallel execution)
- **Symptoms**: Deadlocks, race conditions, inconsistent state across agents
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Start with 2-3 agents in Week 1, scale to 5-8 by Week 4
  - File-level parallelism: agents work on different files (zero conflicts)
  - Explicit coordination: agents check `git status` before modifying shared files
  - Fail fast: surface conflicts immediately, defer to human resolution
- **Fallback Plan**: Single-agent mode with manual task coordination
- **Monitoring**: Track coordination success rate, alert on < 90%

**Risk 2: Git Worktree Complexity**
- **Probability**: Low (20%) | **Impact**: Medium (learning curve for team)
- **Symptoms**: Confusion about worktree vs branch workflows, accidental commits to wrong location
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Automated worktree management via CCPM commands (`/pm:issue-start`)
  - Clear documentation with examples (`.claude/rules/agent-coordination.md`)
  - Training workshop for team (2-hour session in Week 1)
- **Fallback Plan**: Use branches instead of worktrees (loses isolation benefits)
- **Monitoring**: Track team questions/issues, update docs proactively

**Risk 3: LLM API Rate Limits and Costs**
- **Probability**: Medium (40%) | **Impact**: Medium (temporary slowdowns)
- **Symptoms**: 429 errors, increased latency, cost overruns
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Prompt caching to reduce token usage (50-70% savings)
  - Rate limiting: 100 requests/min per agent (configurable)
  - Cost tracking dashboard with daily alerts on > 20% over budget
  - Token-efficient communication (symbols, abbreviations per MODE_Token_Efficiency)
- **Fallback Plan**: Reduce agent parallelism temporarily, batch non-urgent tasks
- **Monitoring**: Real-time cost tracking, automatic throttling on budget limits

**Risk 4: Security Vulnerabilities in Autonomous Code**
- **Probability**: High (48% baseline per Georgetown CSET) | **Impact**: Critical (data breach, production outage)
- **Symptoms**: Hard-coded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, package hallucination
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Constitutional AI framework (pre-commit hooks, self-critique)
  - Automated security scanning (Snyk, Semgrep integration)
  - Package existence verification (prevent 20% slopsquatting rate)
  - Human review gates for critical operations
  - Sandboxed execution environment (Docker)
- **Fallback Plan**: Disable autonomous features, revert to manual code review
- **Monitoring**: Vulnerability detection rate > 95%, zero tolerance for secrets in version control

### Operational Risks

**Risk 5: Team Adoption Resistance**
- **Probability**: Medium (30%) | **Impact**: High (feature not used = zero ROI)
- **Symptoms**: Low usage analytics, continued manual workflows, negative feedback
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Comprehensive training (2-day workshop in Week 4)
  - Champion program: identify early adopters for peer support
  - Gradual rollout: optional in Week 1-2, recommended Week 3-4
  - Success stories: document 2-3x productivity wins early
- **Fallback Plan**: Hybrid workflow (autonomous + manual options)
- **Monitoring**: Usage analytics (tasks completed via agents), satisfaction surveys monthly

**Risk 6: Infrastructure Instability**
- **Probability**: Low (15%) | **Impact**: Medium (temporary service disruption)
- **Symptoms**: MCP server crashes, claude-flow disconnects, database timeouts
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Health monitoring for all MCP servers (30-second interval)
  - Auto-restart mechanisms for crashed services
  - Graceful degradation: fallback to native Claude Code tools
  - Regular dependency updates (weekly security patches)
- **Fallback Plan**: Native tool execution without MCP coordination
- **Monitoring**: Service uptime > 99.5%, MTTD < 5 minutes, MTTR < 30 minutes

### Business Risks

**Risk 7: ROI Below Expectations**
- **Probability**: Low (20%) | **Impact**: High (budget cut, project cancellation)
- **Symptoms**: Velocity improvement < 1.5x, team frustration, missed deadlines
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Focus on high-priority items first (Score ≥ 7.5)
  - Quick wins in Week 1-2 (SuperClaude token savings, basic parallelism)
  - Weekly productivity metric reviews with course correction
  - Baseline measurement before implementation (current velocity, bug rate)
- **Fallback Plan**: Scale back to Phase 1-2 only, defer Phase 3-4 features
- **Monitoring**: Track velocity, token savings, bug rate weekly; adjust roadmap if < 2x by Week 4

**Risk 8: Technology Obsolescence**
- **Probability**: Low (10%) | **Impact**: Medium (need to rebuild on new platform)
- **Symptoms**: Anthropic deprecates APIs, MCP protocol replaced, better alternatives emerge
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Build on open standards (MCP protocol, Git, standard tooling)
  - Avoid vendor lock-in: modular architecture enables component swaps
  - Monitor AI research: allocate 20% time for experimentation
  - Contribute to open-source: influence direction of MCP ecosystem
- **Fallback Plan**: Migrate to alternative orchestration (AutoGen, LangGraph)
- **Monitoring**: Quarterly technology reviews, budget for 1-2 experiments per quarter
